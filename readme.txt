== Description ==

Nimbit is the direct to fan platform that gives artists and their teams the tools they need to create, nurture and monetize a supportive fan base.
With this plugin, it's easier than ever to create a music website for an artist or band. This plugin automatically connects a Nimbit artist account to a WordPress site.  By simply entering your Nimbit username, five pages are instantly created to provide the most popular content demanded by online music fans.  This instant music "web presence" includes: your event calendar, bio, a storefront to purchase and listen to music, and a page for your photo gallery. These pages are automatically populated and updated from your Nimbit artist account. Whenever you update your Nimbit profile your website is automatically updated, offering an incredibly easy way to manage your website after its creation.

Your artist site can contain multiple fan capture tools as sidebar widgets to help you expand and engage your fan base. Our Email Signup, and promomtional code widgets will allow fans to easily interact with you in a way that will encourage further interaction with your band. You can connect your website to the most popular social sites (like Facebook) in one step with our social site sidebar widget. 

Yes, it's that easy, Nimbit takes care of the hard stuff. You don't need to pay someone else to create your website or spend hours coding it yourself, and you won't have to worry about copying and pasting code into places that might not end up working; we do it all for you! Just provide your Nimbit username and this nifty plug-in will do the rest. 

You will need a Nimbit account to activate and start using this plug-in (you can get a free one <a href="http://www.nimbit.com/plans-pricing/?wpdesc1">here</a>). You can set up your artist content (music, photos, merchandise, etc.) with Nimbit either before or after you use this plugin. Once your artist content is in your Nimbit account your site will be populated with it.
